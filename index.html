    the right way to format stuff is this should i make it look pretty? i need to make it less conmertialized but i think this is pretty good progress for day 1. i want to put all of my thoughts out onto the web, even though it looks like trash and no one will prob look at it lmao. maybe i make it so it's a dreamscape. this is pretty basic stuff tho.

    now i can i really make whatever the fuck i want and what would be the goal, oh yeah a thrid place, liminal and wonder, somewhat refined and people can come and sit down and talk to each other, or just with an AI, how do i embed an AI onto my page...input chat and video generation, and is that even my end goal?
